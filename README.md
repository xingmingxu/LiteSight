# LiteSight: Efficient Chart Summarization via LoRA

Contributors: **Xingming Xu**, Nathan Kotni, Qikai Ma, Yinuo Tang

# Setup

Ideally, use Google Colab with access to L4/A100 GPUs to run this project (estimated time: 30 mins on A100 GPU for full fine tuning + eval on A100). Please run with high RAM and on the A100 in Google Colab. It will not run with a less well-performing GPU. Both notebooks will be able to be run with minimal user prompting, just press run in Colab and everything should run automatically.

The details to run each notebook, baseline.ipynb, and with_lora.ipynb, are both contained in the respective notebooks.

model_with_lora.ipynb contains the evaluation of both our fine-tuned model, and the naive method on our metrics.

Additionally, [filtered_dataset.json](https://github.com/xingmingxu/ECS289A-final-project/blob/main/filtered_dataset.json) is our curated dataset, obtained from [Chart-to-text](https://github.com/vis-nlp/Chart-to-text/tree/main/statista_dataset/dataset) which we have repurposed for our project. The script that we used to obtain that json file is located at filterCaptions.py for your reference.
